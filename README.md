# JavaScriptLife

After finishing the 30 Websites in 30 Days project, I did not feel that I had a sufficient understanding of JavaScript as a whole. I wanted to start this new challenge in which I focus solely on making JavaScript applications. My goal at the end is to have obtained a core understanding of the foundational concepts of JavaScript.
